            	Knowing where, when, and what factors create change across landscapes is critical to making sound land management decisions. To support land managers and scientists with this need, a group of leading remote sensing scientists and application specialists in the US Forest Service, US Geological Survey, NASA, and numerous universities have collaborated to develop and produce a Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS).
            	<br><br>
            	LCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape change across the United States. LCMS provides a &#8220;best available&#8221; map of landscape change that leverages advances in time series-based change detection techniques, Landsat data availability, cloud-based computing power, and big data analysis methods.
        		</p>`,

	'products':`<p>LCMS produces annual maps depicting change (vegetation loss and vegetation gain), land cover, and land use from 1985 to present that can be used to assist with a wide range of land management applications. With the help of Regional and National Forest staffs we have identified many applications of LCMS data, including forest planning and revision, updating existing vegetation maps, assessing landscape conditions, supporting post-fire recovery, and meeting some broad-scale monitoring requirements.</p>`,

	'data-availability':`<p>The full suite of LCMS products are now available for the Conterminous United States, Southeastern Alaska, and Puerto Rico-U.S. Virgin Islands. These will be updated annually.</p>`,

	'data-access':`<p>
						LCMS data are available for viewing and download through the <strong>LCMS Data Explorer</strong> (<a href="https://apps.fs.usda.gov/lcms-viewer/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:normal;">https://apps.fs.usda.gov/lcms-viewer/</a>) and also through the links in the table below.<br><br>The LCMS Data Explorer is a web-based application that provides users the ability to view, analyze, summarize and download LCMS data. A user-friendly set of tools allows users to upload an area of interest and perform pixel- and area-based summaries with a charting feature displaying the results of all LCMS outputs. A tutorial is available in the <em>Support</em> menu.<br><br>For questions or more information on LCMS please contact the LCMS helpdesk <a href="mailto:sm.fs.lcms@usda.gov" style="font-weight:normal;">sm.fs.lcms@usda.gov</a>.

        				<p>Appropriate use includes regional to national assessments of vegetation cover, land cover, or land use change trends, total extent of vegetation cover, land cover, or land use change, and aggregated summaries of vegetation cover, land cover, or land use change. This product is the initial output from the modeling process. No post-processing (such as applying a minimum mapping unit or manually burning in known features such as roads) has been performed.</p>`
